            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon. 1.</note> in generall, becauſe meanes muſt be uſed for the obtaining of the things promiſed: for God himſelfe hath ordained; yea, commanded that it ſhould be ſo, if we deſire to <hi>attaine</hi> to the end of our deſires and wiſhes, and to <hi>obtaine</hi> the end of the promiſes; yea, if wee neglect the meanes, we tempt Gods providence, and ſo ſinne againſt him, which our Saviour dared not to doe, that not being Gods way, but the Devils.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34460:16"/>contrarily uſe the meanes carefully which God hath ordained for the preſervation, and conſervation of his life. And therefore although the children of God have many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes confirmed unto them, of protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and providence, yet they muſt pray.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon. 2.</note> more particularly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe prayer is the ordinary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſes, or the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes appointed by God for the obtaining of his promiſes and our deſires: <hi>Prayer</hi> is our <hi>Cornu copioe,</hi> which affords unto us whatſoever is good; our <hi>Delphian ſword,</hi> whereby we overcome all our ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: our <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> or true <hi>Elixar,</hi> which raiſeth us up from death unto life: our <hi>Alexipharmacum generale,</hi> or precious drug, which is good for all ſickneſſes, all ſores, all maladies, all miſeries. <hi>Prayer</hi> is <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa &amp; conditio ſine qua non:</hi> the cauſe and condition without which wee cannot, and by which we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any thing at the hands of God, as is evident from that remarkable place of our Saviours, where <hi>three
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34460:17"/>promiſes</hi> are made to <hi>three precepts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Marth. <hi>7.7.</hi>
                     </note> all denoting and aiming at one and the ſame thing. <hi>Aske, and yee ſhall have; ſeeke, and yee ſhall finde; knocke, and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi> In theſe words ſomething is <hi>expreſſed,</hi> and ſomething <hi>implyed.</hi> That which is <hi>expreſſed</hi> is this, <hi>Aske by prayer, and yee ſhall receive what you aske; Seeke by prayer, and yee ſhall finde what you want; knocke by prayer, and the eares of the Lord, and the doore of mercy ſhall be opened unto you.</hi> That which is <hi>implyed</hi> in this, <hi>No asking by prayer, no recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; no ſeeking by prayer, no finding; no knocking by prayer, no opening.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing <hi>prayer</hi> is the <hi>condition</hi> of the promiſes, wee muſt not neglect prayer, if we deſire the enjoyment, and accompliſhment of the promiſes.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Objection.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againſt this it may bee objected, Many men obtaine many things with out prayer: therefore prayer is not the condition of the promiſes.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedent is proved by theſe three inſtances: namely,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, wicked men who never pray (at leaſt aright) have,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh</hi> 21.7.8.9.10.11.</note> what their hearts deſire; according to the

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Infants enjoy many bleſſings and mercies, and yet praynot. Yea,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the children of God in their mature, and riper yeares, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many favours and pledges of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, when they are negligent in this dutie of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to the firſt I anſwer,<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                        <hi>Anſwer 1.</hi> (a) Peter, Galatin.</note> with <hi>Rabbi Salomon.

Thus he, and thus he truely; for the objection was built upon verſes 10.11. of the 21. Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> and in the 13. verſe of that Chapter, the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34460:18"/>next verſe ſave one: wee have the Hammer which mawles the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>viz. They ſpend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment goe downe into hell.</hi>

                     </note> The anſwer to the firſt inſtance (in a word is this) God gives good temporall bleſſings unto wicked men in his anger, as a curſe, fatting them up therewith unto ſlaughter; and therefore they have ſmall cauſe to bragge, or to bee proud of thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer 2.</note> to the ſecond inſtance, I anſwer two things: to wit,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Infants cannot pray as yet: and therefore God requireth it not of them. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Infants doe pray by crying.<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>147.9.</hi> Pſ. <hi>145.15.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>The Ravens cry unto God</hi> (that is, pray after their manner) <hi>and hee feedes them:</hi> and thus Infants pray when they cry.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer. 3.</note> to the laſt inſtance, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: <hi>That the mercie of the Lord is like a great deepe,</hi> and that hee <hi>meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> not his <hi>mercies</hi> by the buſhell of our merits, giving many good things unto us, when wee are negligent to pray: but this is more then hee hath
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34460:18"/>any where promiſed, the promiſes being conditionall, and depending upon the condition of prayer, as was proved before. And therefore if we would be ſure that the promiſes ſhal be made good unto us, wee muſt not bee negligent, but diligent, conſtant, frequent, and fervent in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon. 3.</note> this may likewiſe bee proved by an Argument, <hi>A majore ad minus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A majore ad minus.</note> taken from the greater to the leſſe. <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee are taught by our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.10. to pray. <hi>Fiat voluntas tua: Thy will be done;</hi> now, although he principally ſpeak there. <hi>De voluntate mandati, of his revealed will;</hi> yet, <hi>voluntas decreti,</hi> his ſecret will is not to bee excluded, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by our Lord himſelfe; who prayeth himſelfe,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>16.39.</hi>
                     </note> as he commandeth us to pray: and expreſſely ſpeakes of the Decree, purpoſe, and ſecret will of God, in theſe words: <hi>Father, not my will, but thy will be fulfilled:</hi> that is, <hi>oh Lord, I have prayed, that this Cup might paſſe from me, but let it not be as I would have it, but as thou haſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined &amp; decreed it ſhould be in thy ſecret will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:34460:19"/>
                  <p>I frame the Argument this:<note place="margin" type="runSum">Argument.</note> Wee muſt pray that the <hi>ſecret will</hi> of God may be <hi>fulfilled;</hi> as wee proved even now: Therefore much more that his <hi>promiſes</hi> may bee <hi>performed</hi> unto us. The neceſſity of the connexion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares thus, Becauſe (as followes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God are <hi>abſolute,</hi> his promiſes are but <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may here bee demanded,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſtion.</note> is not this petition idle, and vaine? Will not God fulfill whatſoever hee hath decreed, whether wee will or not? Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay (ſpeaking of his ſecret and hidden purpoſes,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.19.</note> and decrees) <hi>who hath reſiſted</hi> (or can reſiſt) <hi>his will?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer. 1.</note> certainely the Decrees, and ſecret Determinations of God, are like the Decrees and Lawes of the Medes and Perſians, which cannot be nullified, or made voide; but in his appointed time ſhall ſurely be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. But yet,</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer. 2.</note> there are two things required of all, in regard of Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will, and Decrees: namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A deſire conjoyned with prayer,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34460:19"/>that we may ſubſcribe, aſſent,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Two things required of us, in regard of Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> and freely ſubmit our ſelves unto the will and decrees of God without murmuring. There is in us ſo much corruption, and ſelfe-love, that we are naturally ready to repine and murmure againſt God, when his actions creſſe our affections; and his will is repugnant to ours: and therefore wee deſire that the Lord would pleaſe ſo graciouſly to aſſiſt us by his grace, and ſtrength, that we may patiently beare what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and croſſes ſoever hee hath decreed to inflict upon us, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe us with all; when (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Decree) hee doth bring them to paſſe, and lay them upon us. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe in the Lords ſecret will, he hath certainly decreed both the end and the meanes; both what bleſſings he will give us, and what evils he will remove from us, and free us from: and alſo what meanes wee muſt uſe for the enjoyment of thoſe good things, and eſcaping of thoſe evils: therefore wee muſt humbly beſeech the Lord to give us
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34460:20"/>grace, and ſtrength, to fulfill the conditions that he hath decreed ſhall be fulfilled in us, in ſome part, before we ſhall obtaine the bleſſings which hee determineth to give us. And thus we ſee what wee require in regard of our ſelves, when wee deſire that Gods ſecret will may bee performed and fulfilled: as alſo, that we muſt uſe the meanes of prayer, if wee deſire to partake the promiſes. Now,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon. 4.</note> and laſtly, this is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evident thus, Becauſe the dutie of prayer is good in it ſelfe, pleaſing to our moſt good God, and good and profitable for us. The ſubſtance, and ſubject matter, both of this point and text, being prayer, I muſt neceſſarily expatiate, dilate, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my ſelfe in this reaſon, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then in the former.</p>
                  <p>Three things are here particularly to be handled, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That prayer is good in it ſelfe.</item>
                     <item>2. That it is acceptable unto God.</item>

                  </list>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:34460:20"/>
                  <p>Firſt, prayer is a dutie,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Prayer a good dutie in it ſelfe.</note> 
                     <hi>good in it ſelfe,</hi> and therefore is not to bee omitted, although wee enjoyed whatſoever our hearts could deſire. If the Lord in much mercie ſhould with-hold no good thing, but all evils from us, ſhall we therefore neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect good religious duties? God forbid.</p>
                  <p>That prayer is good,<note place="margin">The proofe</note> appeares thus: to wit,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe God in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the New, have commanded us to pray;<note n="d" place="margin">Pſ. <hi>55.15.</hi> Eſa. <hi>55.6.</hi> Luke <hi>18.1.</hi>
                     </note> and therfore prayer muſt needs be good: <hi>For all the Commandements of the Lord are holy, juſt, and good</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. <hi>12.12.</hi>
                     </note>. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe prayer is a principall part of his worſhip<note n="f" place="margin">Luke. <hi>2.37</hi>
                     </note>, and was alwayes both under the Law and Goſpel, eſteemed by him, as one of his beſt, and moſt acceptable ſacrifices<note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. <hi>50.14. &amp; 141.2</hi> Hoſea <hi>14.2.</hi> Heb. <hi>13.25.</hi> Rov, <hi>5.8. Argument.</hi>
                     </note>: and therefore doubtleſſe it is good.</p>
                  <p>From theſe two particulars, I will frame one Categoricall argument for the <hi>confirming</hi> of the thing <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: viz, that prayer is good in it ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>That which all men were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe, both in the time of both in the time of the Law by the Father, and in the time of the Goſpel by the Sonne; and which is a principall part, both of Legall and Evangelicall worſhip; that muſt needs be good.</p>
                  <p>But prayer is ſuch as hath beene proved in the foregoing particulars.</p>
                  <p>Therefore prayer is good.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Prayer is pleaſing &amp; acceptable unto God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as prayer is good in it ſelfe: ſo it is alſo <hi>acceptable unto God,</hi> as appeares thus: to wit,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin" type="runSum">The proofe.</note> God (as wee ſhowed even now) commands it: and therefore certainly it is a dutie pleaſing unto him, when it is performed well. Shall a father command his Sonne to doe this or that, and not be pleaſed with him when he hath done it according to his will? Certainly a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not ſo doe: and therefore our good and heavenly Father will accept of, and be pleaſed with that which himſelfe preſcribes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it be performed according to his will. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord loves to be ſued, and ſought unto by prayer; and therefore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34460:21"/>it is cleere that it is pleaſing unto him. The more often we goe unto him by prayer, the more welcome we are; the oftner wee begge the more liberall he is: the oftner, and harder that a man ſhakes the fruit tree, the more fruit fals; and the more importunate, inſtant, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant wee are, the more gratefull wee are unto him, and may bee the more certaine to be heard, if wee crave thoſe things which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to hsi will. And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By prayer unto God, we ſhow our dependance upon him; and that wee neither truſt in gold nor, in the wedge of gold; neither upon any Egyptian reede, nor adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any arme of fleſh: but place our whole truſt, hope, confidence, and dependance, in the Lord our God. Prayer is<note n="g" place="margin">Converſso cordis and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                     </note> the turning of the heart unto God, or reflexion of the ſoule upon him: for by prayer wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Lrod takes care for us, and that it is he who gives all good things unto us, as followes by and by.</p>
                  <p>Now this is ſo pleaſing to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34460:22"/>Lord of Glory, for a man in all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, diſtreſſes, and ſtraits, to cleave cloſe unto him, and in the greateſt extremities to cling unto him, and truſt in him,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">IV. It is further evident thus, that prayer is pleaſingunto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they who rightly call upon him, do acknowledge him to be <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, All-mighty, All-good:</hi> More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>

                  <p>That which God commands, and loves: that which argues our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him, and proves and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies him to be, <hi>Omniſcient, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, All-good,</hi> and the <hi>Giver of all good;</hi> that muſt needes be pleaſing, and acceptable unto him.</p>
                  <p>But Prayer is ſuch as was proved in the ofure fore-going particulars.</p>
                  <p>Therefore prayer is pleaſing and acceptable unto God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt not be omitted or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, although we were neither ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of any want or any woe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Prayer is good and profitable for us.</note> as prayer is good in it ſelfe, and pleaſing to our good God, ſo is it alſo good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto our ſelves, as appeares thus</p>

                  <p>To conclude this particular. If prayer be a meanes to exerciſe, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and eſtabliſh our faith: then

                  <p n="4">IV. Prayer is like <hi>Jacobs Ladder,</hi> by which wee mount up unto God: and in this <hi>Ladder</hi> are foure ſtages, ſteps, or degrees: to wit,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Neceſſity conſtrayneth us to pray, and need makes us runne unto God: that is, when we are in a ſtrait, then we turne ſtreight unto God, if there be any grace or religion in us. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The precept of God commandeth us to pray; and he who hath abſolute dominion and power over us, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this duty upon us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if there be any feare of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, this will be a ſecond cord to draw us forward unto prayer. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The promiſes of God treaſured up in the Word, doe ſo certainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us to be heard, that with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and comfort wee powre out our ſoules, and lay our hearts open before God,<note place="margin">Eſa. <hi>37.</hi>
                     </note> as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpread hsi letter before him, when hee ſayd, <hi>See Lord, reard and conſider,</hi> And</p>

                  <p n="4">4 Faith obtaining that which is deſired and promiſed, <hi>in certain hope,</hi> before it be <hi>actually acquired,</hi> or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, ſtayeth the ſoule upon God, and cauſeth the heart to rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious.</p>
                  <p>If we deſire to aſcend, or to mount this <hi>Ladder</hi> more nimbly, then let us ſtep thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when neceſſity pincheth, and poverty paineth us; then we pray.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts enjoyne us to call upon God, then we obey.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when the promiſes of the Word aſſure us, that our prayers ſhall not be <hi>as water ſpilt upon the ground,</hi> or ſent forth in vaine, but ſucceſſefull and proſperous, then we flye with ſwift wings unto God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when faith engageth her ſelfe for the Lord, and becommeth his <hi>Suertie,</hi> that all his promiſes (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they concerne <hi>temporall bleſſings,</hi> or <hi>ſpirituall graces,</hi> or <hi>eternall glory</hi>) ſhal in his due time be made good unto us; then wee are content to waite patiently the Lords leaſure, and to reſt quietly under the ſhadow of his

                  <p>From theſe foure particulars I will frame one generall argument (as I did in the reſt) for the <hi>confirming</hi> of the thing <hi>affirmed;</hi>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">Argument.</note> to wit, <hi>That pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is profitable unto our ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is a meanes to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, encreaſe, and confirme our faith; that which begets pious affections, and augmenteth the love of God in us, and brings comfort unto us, and us unto God, that muſt needs be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for us.</p>
                  <p>But prayer doth all theſe, as was ſhowed in the foure fore-going heads.</p>
                  <p>Therefore prayer is profitable for us.</p>
                  <p>Now from he three maine bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the fourth Reaſon, I will alſo extract one plaine Syllogiſme, for the proofe of the Propoſition firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>viz. That Prayer muſt nto be neglected of us, or omitted by us, although wee had a promiſe of mercy from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is good in it ſelfe,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Argument.</note> and pleaſing unto God, and good, and

                  <p>But Prayer is ſuch a thing as was ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is not to be neglected, or omitted by us, although we had a promiſe that our wants ſhould be ſupplyed, and our evils removed.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have confirmed, and ſtrongly (yea I hope convincingly) proved the truth of the Propoſition,<note place="margin" type="runSum">The fourth proofe of the point.</note> both by <hi>teſtimonies,</hi> and <hi>texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and by <hi>examples</hi> recorded in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as alſo by <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> deduced <hi>from Scripture:</hi> and the fourth proofe of the point onely remaines, namely; the <hi>removall</hi> of theſe <hi>rubbes,</hi> which are layd in the way contrary <hi>to Scripture:</hi> For,</p>

And thus muſt we doe, For the Lord ſtayes untill wee pray; that being the ordinary meanes of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our deſires. Yea although he know our wants before we pray, yet he will take no notice of them untill we pray; and therefore wee muſt by prayer make our wants knowne unto him.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected againe,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Object. 2.</note> If the Lord have made any promiſe of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any good thing unto us,<note place="margin">

                  <p>If it be objected,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Objection. 1 <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19.20.</note> we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>That where two or three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the name of Chriſt, there the Lord hath promiſed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi> I anſwer,</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, the truth is,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer 4.</note> that this promiſe is hypotheticall, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall; and therefore if we continue <hi>Ponere obicem,</hi> to lay ſtumbling blocks in the Lords way, to provoke him unto wrath, to fulfill, and fill full to the brim, the conditions of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but not of mercie; wee then cannot expect the performance of this promiſe; for promiſes which are conditionall (as all revealed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are) ſhall not bee performed

Let us not ſay, <hi>Homo proponit, Deus diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit.</hi> We may purpoſe and practice what wee will, but the purpoſe of God ſhall ſtand, and his providence doth diſpoſe of all things: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this bee moſt true, yet ſo is this alſo. <hi>That ſecret things</hi> belongs unto God, and <hi>revealed things unto men.</hi> And therefore let us not <hi>looke</hi> to that which we can never <hi>ſee,</hi> nor <hi>prie</hi> into that which we can never <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,</hi> nor <hi>enquire</hi> after that which we can never <hi>finde out;</hi> I meane the Decrees, purpoſes, and <hi>ſecret will</hi> of God: But let us looke to his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34460:35"/>will,</hi> and precepts, and therein we ſhall ſee the neceſſity of the uſe of ordinary and lawfull meanes. The neceſſity of the means appeares two manner of wayes unto us: to wit,
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe it is evill to neglect the Meanes.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe it is good to uſe the Meanes.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. To neglect lawfull and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Meanes is evill, it being either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Deſperateneſſe, when a man is without hope of reaping good by them: although God have annexed, and promiſed a bleſſing unto the uſe of them. Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Unthankfulneſſe unto God, who provides them as helpes againſt our infirmities, and wants. Or,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sloth, when a man will not trouble himſelfe with the uſe of the Meanes, although the Lord have commanded the uſe of them. Or,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A preſumptuous tempting of God, when a man expects good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of them: for wee tempt God in his promiſes, when wee hope to enjoy what wee deſire, although
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34460:36"/>we neglect the uſe of thoſe lawfull meanes which God hath allowed, and commanded us to uſe. The Divell tempts Chriſt thus to tempt the protection,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. As the neceſſity of good meanes appeares by the evilneſſe of the neglect thereof, ſo alſo by the goodneſſe of the carefull uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the diligent uſe of naturall meanes, (as meates, medicines, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, circumſpection, and the like) wee ſhow moſt wiſedome, and that we are not like beaſts without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the carefull uſe of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall meanes, as Prayer, Faſting, the Word, Sacraments, and the like, wee ſhew moſt grace, and that wee are not as men which know not God. But of this by and by in the fourth particular: <hi>viz.</hi> what meanes we muſt uſe.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:34460:36"/>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Two Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the uſe of the Meanes. Caution 1.</note> wee have here further two Cautions to be obſerved in the uſe of the meanes; namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the uſe of the meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the end. Separate not thoſe which God hath conjoyned; ſever not the meanes from the end, nor the end from the meanes.<note place="margin" type="runSum">A ſimilitude</note> A meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger muſt not ſo minde his way that he forget his errand. To ſeparate the meanes and end whereunto or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily they lead, is vanity in all courſes: but in divine matters, or matters of much moment, meere madneſſe. He who ſinneth without repentance, and yet hopes to eſcape hell, ſeparates the end from the meanes. Hee who expects heaven without faith and obedience, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the meanes from the end which he aimes at. And thoſe who looke to the Court of Parliament where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are called, and conſider not the end wherefore they are thereunto called (<hi>viz.</hi> the Glory of God, the honour of his ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, the proſperity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, the welfare of the Commons, the peace of the land,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34460:37"/>and the advanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of true religion) ſeparate the end from the meanes. But, <hi>Quae ſupra nos, nihil ad nos;</hi> My tractate may be called <hi>the pious mans practice in Parliament time;</hi> not the <hi>dutie of Parliament men,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe not belonging much unto us, being above us, I will therefore paſſe them by, and paſſe unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Caution which concernes us: namely,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Aſcribe not too much to the meanes uſed.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Caution 2.</note> Here obſerve that wee aſcribe, and give too much to the uſe of the meanes two manner of wayes: to wit,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When wee conceive and hold the meanes ſo neceſſary, that we fall into the uſe of unlawfull meanes, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, when hee went unto the Witch at <hi>Endor;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.17.</note> and <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> when hee ſent unto <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the God (or Idol) of <hi>Ekron.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 1.2.</note> When there is any thing amiſſe in Church or Common-wealth, wee muſt not for the rectifying thereof, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to inſurrections, rebellions, ſeditious practiſes, or any unjuſt, or unwarrantable courſes, but onely
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34460:37"/>unto lawfull meanes; as making our moane to Magiſtrates, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing our complaints unto them, and making knowne our greevances unto Parliaments, and the like. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee aſcribe too much to the uſe of the meanes, when we attribute helpe unto them, or truſt in them: as <hi>Aſah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.12.</note> who did not onely <hi>uſe Phyſicke</hi> (for that was <hi>lawfull</hi>) but <hi>truſted</hi> in the <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> which was <hi>unlawfull.</hi> And hence ſometimes the meanes faile, and ſucceed not: as we ſee in <hi>Gehazies</hi> laying his Maſters ſtaffe upon the childe. Wherefore,<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.31.</note> if we deſire the continuance, and proſperous ſucceſſe of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; let us not truſt in it, but in God by it: Let us not aſcribe any thing unto the meanes, nor place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confidence in the meanes, but onely deſire the bleſſing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and upon all their conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Let us looke upon God as the alone Author, and gracious Giver of all good, and beſeech him ſo to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, inſtruct, &amp; aſſiſt thoſe his ſervants and inſtruments, that hee may doe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34460:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>much good unto us by their meanes. For if we ſhall looke no further than the aſſembly, or perſons aſſembled, and expect a bleſſing upon their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, without having an eye to the bleſſing and aſſiſtance of God, wee ſhould then a ſcribe too much to the meanes uſed. And thus much for the Cautions.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">The means to be uſed is Prayer.</note> conſider we now what meanes muſt be uſed by us for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the end of our deſires and wiſhes.</p>
                  <p>The meanes which our Text tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us to uſe, for the removall of evils, and the obtaning of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, is <hi>Prayer.</hi> Here therefore therein obſerve onely two things (and that very briefly) <hi>viz.</hi> 1 What prayer is. And 2. How it muſt be ſo qualified, that it may be a meanes to procure unto us our deſires, and Gods promiſes.</p>
                  <p>Prayer may be thus defined:<note place="margin" type="runSum">Definition of Prayer.</note> It is the colloquie, or diſcourſe of the ſoule with God: or it is the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aſſent of the ſoule unto God, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at his hands thoſe things which concerne his glory, the ſalvation of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34460:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>our ſoules, the preſervation of our bodies, lives, and eſtates, according to his will, in, by, and through the merits of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>If it be demanded,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſtion.</note> how may we be certaine, that our prayers which we powre out before, and offer up unto the Lord; ſhall bee heard, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? I anſwer briefly from the Text.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer 1.</note> pray unto one who is able to helpe us, as poore men begge of rich, and not of the poore, ſo let us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our ſupplications, and ſend up our requeſts unto the Lord our God, who is omnipotent, able to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will in heaven and earth; and above all that we are able to aske or thinke. For thus doth our holy Prophet in the Text, <hi>O, God ſave us with thy right hand.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let us be ſuch,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer 2.</note> as God hath promiſed to helpe. The perſon here praying unto the Lord,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.</note> is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who <hi>ſerved him with a perfect heart,</hi> and <hi>kept his Commandements with his whole heart;</hi> and therefore the Lord did preſerve him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.31.</note> according to his promiſe made unto him. This
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34460:39"/>was a truth ſo cleare, that a blind man could ſee it, that <hi>God heares not finners, but if any man be righteous, him he will heare.</hi> And therefore let us <hi>heare God,</hi> if we deſire that he ſhould <hi>heare us.</hi> Let us purge our ſelves from ſinne, as hee commands, and then he will preſerve us as he hath promiſed. Let us <hi>ſincerely ſerve him,</hi> and he will <hi>ſurely ſave us.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer 3.</note> let us aske ſuch things as he hath promiſed to give, and grant, or which are agreeable unto his will, and pleaſing unto his Majeſtie.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.13.</note> The Pſalmiſt prayes here for preſervation from evill, and our Saviour teacheth us to pray. <hi>Deliver us from evill:</hi> and therefore it is agreeable to the will of God that wee ſhould pray for protection againſt evils, and for the removeall of them when they lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. And</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer 4.</note> let us pray unto God in that manner, that himſelfe hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; that is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Let us pray for others; not for our ſelves onely: as <hi>David</hi> here doth. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2 For generall bleſſings let us pray
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34460:39"/>generally, <hi>when two conſent together,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19.</note> 
                     <hi>and offer up their prayers with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, their voyce is heard.</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Let us pray fervently. That bird is held beſt, that ſits upmoſt in the neaſt, and drawes in moſt ſpirits: and thoſe are the beſt petitioners, who are ſtill gaping up to heaven fervently by prayer. It was ſaid of <hi>Luther, Quod voluit, potuit:</hi> Hee was ſo fervent, and zealouſly earneſt in his prayers unto God, that he could obtaine any thing at his hands.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11.</note> And</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Let us continue and perſevere in prayer untill our ſuit be heard, and ſupplication granted, or the will of God revealed concerning the thing which we pray for. To ſumme up all this in few words, let us all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that our perſons may be pleaſing and acceptable unto God; and our hearts and lives purged from all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſinne, and beautified, and adorned with purity and ſanctitie: and then let us all cry mightily unto God, (becauſe <hi>vis unita fortior,</hi> many faithfull perſons joyning together in fervent prayers, do quickly prevaile with God) Let us all (I ſay) pray,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34460:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>yea let us all pray fervently unto our God (who is able to helpe us) for the good ſucceſſe of this preſent Chriſtian aſſembly, and let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue theſe our prayers for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof, and a bleſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, untill the Lords will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed concerning the event, fruit, and effect thereof. Thus we have done with the former branch of this laſt Uſe, to wit, <hi>That meanes muſt be uſed:</hi> the ſecond and laſt onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, namely, that wee having uſed theſe meanes, which God hath commanded, and as hee commanded, we may then confidently expect the bleſſings and mercies promiſed and deſired; which was the ſecond ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
                  <p>What hath God promiſed?<note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſtion. Anſwer. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.13. &amp; 15.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.23. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>where two or three are gathered together in his Name, hee will be in the midst of them: and that whatſoever we aske of him, in the Name, and for the ſake of Chriſt our Lord, wee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi> And therefore let us with one tongue, one voyce, one minde, one heart, from the heart, and with the utmoſt intention of the heart, pray

And thus many in the Primitive times were perſecuted, onely becauſe they were more holy, and pure than the common ſort, and would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company, nor communicate with them in their wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>At ſuch time as the <hi>Epheſi</hi> baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Prince <hi>Hermodonus,</hi>

This in a word is the epitomie of all evils, and in this word <hi>Warre</hi> all woes are wrapped up: for, warre begets bloodſhed, and murder, bloodſhed begets noyſome ſmels, noyſome ſmells and vapours corrupt the aire, the aire being corrupted breeds the plague, peſtilence, and ſickneſſe: where the ſword and plague are, husbandry, and trading, are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and where trading and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry are hindred, there followes famine, penury, and poverty. And therefore I may conclude this branch either with the ſaying of the Poet, <hi>Nulla ſalus bello, pacem te poſcimus omnes.</hi> Becauſe there is neither health, joy, ſafety, nor profit in warre, therefore the Lord in mercie
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34460:68"/>bleſſe us with the bleſſing of peace. Or I may conclude this with the ſaying of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concerning drunkenneſſe; <hi>Longè eſt à nobis, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſereberis ne appropinquet nobis.</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, the maine cauſe of the deſtruction of a Nation is ſinne, and ſpirituall rebellion. Now when I conſider the nature and number, the quantity, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our ſinnes in this Land, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but acknowledge, that if the Lord ſhould enter into judgement with us, hee might juſtly bring a totall ſubverſion, and deſolation upon us, for our many, great and clamorous ſinnes. And therefore this branch concerning us ſo nearly, and in ſo high a nature, I will crave leave of my Reader, to enlarge my ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little more than in any of the former.</p>
                  <p>And let me intreat every Chriſtian who reads this, to obſerve with mee, that when I ſay, <hi>Sinne is the cauſe of the ſubverſion of a State,</hi> it may either be underſtood of ſinne in generall, or of particular ſins.</p>

For it cannot chuſe but breede a great miſchieſe in a Common-wealth, when juſtice ſleepeth, and the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe boldneſſe of evill dooers is not curbed in with a birdle, but runneth its owne ſwinge: and therefore a Conſul of <hi>Rome</hi> could ſay, <hi>That is was an evill thing to have a Prince, under whom liconce and liberty is given unto every man to doe what him liſteth.</hi> And therefore wee ſhould pray that all good Lawes may be executed, and that the Magiſtrate may not hold the ſword of juſtice for nought.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">4. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the word.</note> the contempt of the word of God is another maine cauſe of the deſolation of a State. I will for the cleere proofe of this, beauſe it necrely concernes us, alleadge and urge onely one place of Scripture; namely, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 5.24 where wee have theſe words. <hi>As the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame conſumeth the chaffe, ſo their roote ſhall be rottenneſſe, and their bleſlome ſhall goe up as duſt: becauſe they have caſt away the Law
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34460:74"/>of the Lord of Hoſts, and deſpiſed the word of the holy one of Iſrael.</hi> Three things are here worthie of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for our preſent purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What is threatned.</item>
                     <item>2. Who are threatned.</item>
                     <item>3. Why they are threatned. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Lord doth not ſay, that his anger towards them for the contempt of his word ſhall bee like fire in a houſe, but like fire amongſt ſtubble, and ſtraw. That is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their deſtruction ſhall be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.16 <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.4.</note> there ſhall be nothing left, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall any bee able to free them from the Lords juſt wrath. If a houſe be one fire, it may be put out; yea, though it be not, all is not burnt, for all materials in a houſe are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible: but there is no quenching of ſtubble being once on fire, neither is any thing thereof left unburnt: and ſuch is the wrath of God againſt the centemners of his word. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Their deſtruction ſhall bee ſudden, and come upon them like a whirle-winde. If a houſe be on fire, it is a long time on burning, but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34460:74"/>ſtubble, and ſtraw being once kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, are conſumed in a moment, and (as it were) in the twinkling of an eye. And thus the wrath of God will come ſuddenly, and violently, and like an armed man, upon all the contemners and deſpiſers of his word, without repentance. And therefore let us kiſſe the Sonne,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa</hi> 29.5, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11.</note> and labour to be reconciled unto the Father, <hi>for if his wrath bee kindled, yea but a little, bleſſed are all they that are at peace with him.</hi> And thus wee ſee what is threatned, <hi>viz.</hi> totall and ſudden deſtruction. Now,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Obſerve here who they are who are threatned, <hi>viz. roote</hi> and <hi>bloſſome;</hi> what is meant by this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphore, is not generally agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Interpreters. For.</p>

And</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Obſerve wee, why they are thus fearfully threatned: <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they contemne and deſpiſe the Word and Law of God.</hi> Now if wee would know who they are who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Word; they are</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Thoſe who contemne the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Word, being altogether feareleſſe of them; and ſay, Tuſh, let him come. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Thoſe who deſpiſe the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Word, not beleeving them at all. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thoſe who ſleight the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of the Word, not obeying them at all. And</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Thoſe who lightly regard the authority of the Word, ſaying, I will do what the Word forbids, in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34460:75"/>deſpight thereof. And</p>
                  <p n="5">Thoſe who do not much prize, and value the Word, are contemners of it. And</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Thoſe who deſpiſe reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or are angry when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proed by the Word, are alſo juſtly ſaid to contemne it.</p>
                  <p>Now it will eaſily appeare by the particulars, how nearly this belongs unto us, in this Land. For how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have wee amongſt us, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the comminations, and threatnings of the Word, daily ſounded in their eares, runne on to ſinne, as a horſe unto the battle, with all wicked violence, and impetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being altogether fearleſſe of the wrath, or judgements of God? How many have wee amongſt us, that neither queſtion the truth of the divine promiſes of the Word, or at leaſt wil not be allured by them unto obedience? How many have wee that with the Cocke, had rather have a barly corne, than a pretious orient jewell; and with the Aſſe, a bottle of hay, rather than Nactar, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſia, and like the Iſraelites, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34460:76"/>the fleſh pots of Egypt, before the riches of Canaan; and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſinne, which are but for a ſeaſon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11</note> before the pleaſure which are at Gods right hand for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? and all this through unbeleefe of the promiſes: How many amongſt us are there, who deſpiſe and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the admonitions, and precepts of the word;<note place="margin">Ier. 44.16.</note> and although they be daily inſtructed and taught, yet will not learne? How many have we that ſtubbornly and perverſly ſay, with that ſtubborne and perverſe people, <hi>The word that thou ſpeakeſt unto us, in the Name of the Lord, wee will not doe it, but we will do whatſoever proceedes out of our owne mouthes?</hi> How many are there amongſt us, who lightly regard, and baſely eſteeme, of the Goſpell, and the glad tidings of peace and ſalvation: and are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, whether Popery or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaniſme, whether Chriſtianitie or Heatheniſme, whether truth or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, get the upper hand in our land, if ſo be it may but goe well with them in outward things? How many have wee, who will not endure patiently
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34460:76"/>the word of reprehenſion, but often-times proſecute and perſecute with virulent hatred and malice, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters of the word of God, becauſe from the Lord, and by the Commandement of the Lord, they reprove their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>And therefore may wee not juſtly feare that the Lord hath a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie with us for theſe things? and that hee will be avenged on ſuch a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is this of outs? May wee not truly feare that the fire of Gods fury will fall upon us, as a flame amongſt the ſtubble, for our great and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous contempt of the Word? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, when wee looke upon our ſelves and ſinnes, we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it is of the Lords great and mere mercie, that wee are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conſumed. Wherefore let us provoke him no longer, leſt he turne his love into hatred, his ſmiles into frownes, his amity into enmity, and let his little finger henceforth lye more heavie upon us than his whole loynes have done heretofore. If the Reader would ſee the fearfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Lord hath inflicted
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34460:77"/>upon thoſe places, or perſons which have conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned his word, let him read the places quoted in the Margent<note n="a" place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.29. 30. <hi>&amp;c.

                     </note> If he deſire to looke home, then let him remember, and obſerve, a Hiſtory or two of our owne: namely. The Lord ſtirred up <hi>Gildas</hi> a godly learned man, to preach to the old <hi>Britons,</hi> and to exhor them to repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life, and to forewarne them of plagues to come if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not: but what availed it? For godly <hi>Gildas</hi> was laughed to ſcorne, and taken for a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:<note place="margin">Acts and Monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. foL 3 2.</note> and our bold <hi>Britons,</hi> with whoriſh faces, and unrepentant hearts went forward in their ſinnes: but what followed? The Lord to puniſh this their contempt of his Word and Miniſters, ſent in their enemies on every ſide, and deſtroying them gave their Land to other Nations. Againe after this, Almighty God ſeeing Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Superſtition, Hypocriſie, and wicked living uſed in this Land, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up that godly learned man <hi>Iohn Wickliffe</hi> to preach unto our Fathers repentance, and to exhort them to forſake their idolatry and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34460:77"/>but his exhortations were not regarded, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily both himſelfe, and his ſervant were deſpiſed, and himſelfe and his bookes after his death burned. Now what enſued hereupon: A moſt grievous and heavie vengeance: for they ſlew their lawfull King, and ſet up three other on a row, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom all the Noble bloud was ſlaine up, and halfe the Commons deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and what by warre in France, and civill diſcord among themſelves, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Townes were decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the land brought halfe to a wilderneſſe. And therefore ſeeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of, diſobedience unto the word of God, is a maine cauſe of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and deſolation, both of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34460:78"/>Churches and States, let us take heede thereof, if wee deſire that ours may long ſtand, and flouriſh.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>third Propoſition</hi> being thus ſuccinctly handled, I goe forward unto the fourth,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Propoſition IV.</note> namely,</p>
                  <p>That it is the Lord, and he alone, who protects and preſerves, who bleſſeth and proſpers both Princes and people, countries and common-wealths, Churches and States. Or, That all preſervations, mercies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, and blesſings, which any people, Nation, Church, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage enjoyes, come from God, and from him alone. Or, the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Hovv the point is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Text.</note> confirmation, conſervation, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py adminiſtration, protection, and proſperous ſucceſſe of Kingdomes, Common-wealths, and Churches, comes from God.</p>
                  <p>How naturally this point ariſeth from the text, will eaſily appeare, if wee conſider in the text but theſe two things, to wit,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What our Kingly Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for himſelfe and his people; namely, protection, preſervation, and deliverance from evill, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in peace, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of whom he begs theſe things;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34460:79"/>viz. of the Lord.<note place="margin" type="runSum">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition proved.</note> 
                     <hi>Save thou us O Lord with thy right hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of the point will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare by a particular or two. viz.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Kingdomes and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are diſpoſed of by God, and he gives them to whom he pleaſes, as is plaine from theſe places, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21. <hi>and</hi> 4.17.25, 32. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Ier.</hi> 27.6. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>Iob.</hi> 12.18. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Kingdomes and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are confirmed and eſtabliſhed by God, and he makes them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lord preſerveth a people from their enemies, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by <hi>Num.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.1. <hi>and</hi> 147.12, 13., And</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Lord gives a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple victory over their enemies, as is proved by theſe places. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.6 <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.1. <hi>and</hi> 25.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.33. <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> 46.9. <hi>and</hi> 118.15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.31. And</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the happy adminiſtration of a Common-wealth comes from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34460:79"/>God; as is cleare by the examples of thoſe, under whom Churches and Kingdomes have flouriſhed, becauſe (as the Scripture ſaith) God was with them. Read to this purpoſe, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 15. <hi>Iud.</hi> 6.12, 16. <hi>and</hi> 11.29. <hi>and</hi> 13.24., And therefore Magiſtrates may here learne a threefold dutie; namely,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to implore the bleſſing of the Lord,<note place="margin" type="runSum">3. things required in a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</note> and to beſeech him ſo to enable them to goe in and out, wiſely before his people, that the Common-wealth may be peaceably proſperouſly, and religiouſly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, under, and by them,</p>
                  <p>This was the ſuit of <hi>David,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.11.16. and of <hi>Solomon.</hi> 1. <hi>King</hi> 3.7. and of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Numb.</hi> 27.15, 16. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Magiſtrates may learn hence, not to truſt unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the adminiſtration of a Common-wealth, but unto the Lord, from whom all ſufficiency thereunto comes, neither to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate or aſcribe any thing unto themſelves, or to their wiſedome, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34460:80"/>prudence, or policy, or diligence, or watchfulneſſe, although they ſee the Common-wealth to proſper and flouriſh under them; but to aſcribe all Glory and Honour unto God, who both enables them to execute and diſcharge their places, and alſo bleſſeth their endeavours. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, both to bleſſe Magiſtrates in themſelves, and to bleſſe their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and to proſper their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under them, if they will but walke in his wayes ſincerely, and obey his will, and rule and governe according to his word; therefore if they deſire the accompliſhment of this promiſe, they muſt fulfill this condition: but of this more amply by and by.</p>
                  <p>A Common-wealth is like a City, wherein are obſervable theſe foure things, to wit,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the foundation, or ground-worke thereof, which ſupports the whole Fabricke, and this is Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Iuſtice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The gates thereof, which are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34460:80"/>the ſtrength of the City, and thoſe are the Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lawes whereby the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates governe. And</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Citizens, people, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which are ruled and governed by the Magiſtrates, according to thoſe Lawes. Now ſomething of all theſe, in that which followes.</p>
                  <p>The Lord, we ſay, bleſſeth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpereth, preſerveth, and cauſeth to flouriſh Churches and States: now the queſtion is, how hee doth this? I anſwer, not by miracles, but by meanes; and therefore if we deſire the preſervation, peace, proſperity, and happineſſe of this our Church, and Common-wealth, then let us uſe thoſe meanes which God hath appointed, and walk in thoſe wayes which lead thereunto. Here obſerve that there are ſome things required both in Magiſtrates and people, ſom things in Magiſtrates alone, &amp; ſome in people alone, if we deſire that our Common-wealth may flouriſh, and be proſperous and bleſſed: now of al theſe particularly, and in order.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34460:81"/>
                  <p>Firſt, the duty both of Superiours, and inferiours, both of Magiſtrates and people, if they deſire and wiſh the welfare of that State wherein they live, is fivefold, namely,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, both of them, or every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Land, muſt in general la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to the utmoſt of his power, for the peace &amp; proſperity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. For as the temper of the world doth conſiſt of contrary elements, after a wonderfull harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſo a Common-wealth doth ſtand by the diverſe endeavours of men. And as a Set or Conſort of Muſicke is ſweet, if every one obſerve his time, notes, and cliffes, but ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, if ſung or plaid confuſedly, without any order or harmony; ſo if in a Kingdome or Common-wealth, every one look to his owne place, and do his owne duty in his place, then that State will flouriſh and proſper.</p>
                  <p>Therfore let every member of this our Common-wealth, looke to his owne affaires, and do that which hee ought to doe, and we may then confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34460:81"/>expect a bleſſing from God upon us. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">2. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one muſt ceaſe to doe evill.</note> every member of this our body politicke ought to be cut off, whatſoever is evill, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move whatſoever is in any of them, or amongſt them, which endangers, or harmes the Common-wealth. If there bee any thing in any part of the body which is banefull or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the whole body, wee out it cut, or off, becauſe that we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taer that ſome one part of the body ſhould periſh, then that the whole ſhould be deſtroyed. And thus in the body of a Common-wealth, let us for the conſervation of the whole, take away whatſoever might hurt or haſten the ruine thereof, and let none, who beares the name of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, take any ſuch courſe (as too many doe) that for the enriching of themſelves, care not though they ruine the Common-wealth. And</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>Where wee ſee, that they ſought not their owne gaine, but onely did execute juſt judgment upon the Enemies of the Church. And therefore being compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with ſuch a cloud of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.24. let us follow their foot-ſteps; and thus ſeeke the welfare, and flouriſhing eſtate of our Church, and Common-Wealth, by preferring the good of that, before our owne private ends. And</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:34460:84"/>
                  <p>And fourthly, let every member of this our politicke and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke body, labour for unity, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, and concord. For this is the chiefeſt ornament, yea one of the ſureſt ſupports, that either City, Province, Kingdome, Common-wealth or Church can have. And therefore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth ſo highly extoll concord and unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt brethren,<note place="margin">Pſa. 122.3.4.5. &amp; 133.1.2.</note> of one region, and religion. And <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſhewes the neceſſity of it, where he ſaith, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordià parvae res creſcunt; diſcordia maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae dilabuntur:</hi> Proſperity attends concord and unity, but adverſity and miſery, diſſention &amp; diſcord; as was demonſtrated by that old man, who gave his ſonnes a bundle of Arrowes bound cloſe together to breake, and when none of them could doe it, he unbound them, and then being looſe, every one could breake them. And thus (as it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by our Hiſtorians and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers) ſo long as we in this Land keepe the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace, and labour that there
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34460:84"/>may be peace betwixt us &amp; our God, and unity and concord amongſt our ſelves, we need feare neither enemies nor evils. Now this concord which is deſired, is in that which is good, not in that which is evill: namely, unity and concord in true religion; and in a lawful adminiſtration of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and right; and in procuring and defending publike honeſty; and in promoting the publike good, and the like. And therefore if we deſire that our Church and State may flouriſh, let us all labour to be of one mind, and on judgement; at leaſt let us take heed of diſſention, diſcord, jarres, and all breaches, which may either deſtroy or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe the peace and welfare of that Church and Common-wealth wherein we live.</p>
                  <p>And fifthly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">V. All muſt be converted by the Preaching of the word.</note> another thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the whole body politicke, if we deſire that our Church and State ſhould ſtill ſtand, continue, and flouriſh, is to doe, as <hi>Niniveh</hi> did: namely, to repent, and turne unto God by the preaching of the word.

And that both in true humiliation of heart, and alſo in exemplary reverence and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, (as the King of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and the Nobles did) they being the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and leaders of the flocks. Now noble Captaines never ſay, <hi>Ite, ſed ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> goe yee and fight, but come, let us goe. And therefore when any publike danger is doubted, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction feared, or any generall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſpeciall bleſſing deſired; then both Prince and people, noble and ignoble, high and low, paſtor and flocke, ſhould</p>

                  <p>Firſt, the ſupreme Magiſtrate, is the King ſacred Majeſtie;<note place="margin" type="runSum">The dutie of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is two-fold. viz. 1 To be holy.</note> now in him two things are required: namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To continue to lead his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by a holy example, <hi>Homer</hi> cals Kings <hi>Diogenes, The generation of the Gods,</hi> and <hi>Diotrephes, Men nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Gods;</hi> and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith of them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 86.</note> 
                     <hi>That they are Gods,</hi> that is, that they ſhould be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34460:87"/>as men obedient unto God, and as gods, exemplary unto men. As the ordinary <hi>Load-stone</hi> which draweth Iron unto it, is it ſelfe drawne by the <hi>Aethiopian Load-stone;</hi> ſo Kings, who draw their people af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them by their example, ſhould be drawne themſelves unto the Lord, by his; ſeeing they repreſent him unto us. It was ſaid long ſince,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis.</hi> That is, people frame their lives according to the example of their Prince; and daily experience hath proved the truth of this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hiſtorians tell us, that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the great, and <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> were both wry necked, the one by nature, and the other by cuſtome; And therefore all their followers did hang the head upon one ſhoulder. <hi>Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Emperour loved Red Wine beſt; And therefore <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatus</hi> would palnt no other Grapes, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> for a time loved <hi>Plato</hi> well, and then all his followers turned Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34460:88"/>Such as the colour of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Rods were,<note place="margin">Hector Pint. Eze. <hi>17.</hi>
                     </note> ſuch was the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the cattell which were bred of the ſheepe conceiving in the ſight of the rods: ſo as the actions of the Prince are, ſuch are wont to be the cogitations, and converſation of the ſubjects. As other beaſts levell their looks at the countenance of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and birds make wing as the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle flyes: ſo people will imitate their Princes. If <hi>Trajane</hi> be juſt, then all the people will ſtudy juſtice. If <hi>Octavius</hi> delight in Poeſie, then every one will ſtrive to be a Poet. If <hi>Cornelius</hi> feare God, then ſo will alſo all his houſhold do. And therefore unto the flouriſhing, and eſtabliſhing of a Church or Sate, in peace, purity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and righteouſneſſe, it is very requiſite and neceſſarie, that the Prince be zealous, and religious. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is further required in a Prince,<note place="margin" type="runSum">2 To take unto him Aſſiſtants.</note> to take unto him the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of others, that is, wiſe, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and grave Counſellers ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily; and Parliaments upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34460:88"/>urgent, or important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. For as a vine, although it be the nobleſt of all trees, yet need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſupportation of reeds, props, and of other unfruitfull trees; ſo Princes and Potentates need the helpe of inferiour perſons. Yea as the hand is not the weaker, becauſe it is divided into fingers, but fuller of agility to labour: ſo in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the buſineſſes are better done,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> which are imparted unto many. And therefore ſeeing Kingdomes and Common-wealths are not weakned, or made worſe, but contrarily bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and made more ſtrong, by the helpe and aſſiſtance, of able Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, &amp; religious Parliaments; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe are requiſite to be uſed by the Supreme Magiſtrate, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the Church and State ſhould flouriſh and proſper under him.<note place="margin" type="runSum">The duty of Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</note> Now</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a Subordinate Magiſtrate; that is, thoſe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Supreme &amp; placed by him, in place of authority. Here now obſerv, that the Subordinate Magiſtrate is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34460:89"/>either <hi>In fieri,</hi> or in <hi>facto;</hi> in <hi>potentia,</hi> or <hi>actu.</hi> That is, ſome are to be choſen Magiſtrates hereafter, and ſome are Magiſtrates already.

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, if we deſire that our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth may proſper and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, then ſome things are required in thoſe who are to be admitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Magiſtracy, and to be looked unto by thoſe, who admit them, and commit the government of the Common-wealth unto them. As namely,<note place="margin" type="runSum">1 Such as are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ought to be wiſe, and underſtanding men, and learned in the Lawes. As the body is without members, ſo is the Common-wealth without Lawes; and as a diſtracted or doltiſh head, doth ſmall good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body, even ſo an ignorant Magiſtrate doth ſmall good unto the State. And thereforefore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that thoſe who are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Magiſtracy, be men wel acquainted with the Lawes of the Land wherein they are. There was a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34460:89"/>time appointed unto the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>estals,</hi> 1. Wherein they ſhould learne. 2. Wherein they ſhould exerciſe that they had learned. and 3. Wherein they ſhould teach others; and thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did <hi>Diana's</hi> Prieſts at <hi>Epheſus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> So they are to doe, who are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the government of a Common-wealth. For it becommeth him who governeth to be learned (the better to know what he doth) and wiſe (to find out how he ought to doe it) and diſcreet, (to attend, and take opportunity by the fore-top) and reſolute in the action of juſtice, without corruption of feare of any. The maſter of the Shippe ſets ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the helme, to ſteere and direct her: but it is a ſhame for a Magiſtrate to execute. his place, and adminiſter juſtice by a Deputie, being altogether unable himſelfe to doe it, by reaſon of his ignorance in the Lawes and Statutes of the Realme. Yea honeſtie and a good meaning are not enough in Magiſtrates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ability; for although they mean
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34460:90"/>well, yet often by doing amiſſe they endanger and indamage both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others. <hi>Gracchus,</hi> ſon of that <hi>Gracchus</hi> that had beene twice Conſull, meaning well to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but (for want of knowledge) managing it undiſcreetly, was ſlaine in the Capitoll by <hi>Cornelius Scipio Naſica,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Appian.</note> and his followers. And hence it was that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo earneſtly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto God; <hi>To give him wiſedome, and knowledge,</hi> or the ſpirit of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the right adminiſtration of the Common-wealth. Or, by <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> (as <hi>Tremellius</hi> thinks) he means knowledge, to wit, of the lawes of right and juſtice, and of the duties which belong unto him to doe, as he is a Magiſtrate. To teach us, that it behoves a Magiſtrate to ſeeke after the knoweldge of the Lawes of that Nation wherein he dwels. Hence <hi>Samuel</hi> writ the lawes of their Land in a booke:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.25.</note> and when the people crownd <hi>Ioaſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chr. 23.11.</note> they put the booke of the Teſtimony in his hand: and this booke, every King and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate muſt have a copy of, which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34460:90"/>they muſt read diligently, that they may diſcharge their functions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law; becauſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is not to be governed <hi>Ad placitum</hi> as Magiſtrates liſt, but according to the Laws of the Land. And</p>

                  <p>As a Land cannot long laſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Lawes, ſo almoſt as good no Lawes, as no execution of the Lawes; For it is in a manner all one, for Magiſtrates to make no Lawes, and to execute no Lawes which are made. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, that a Common-wealth conſiſted of two things, viz. Reward and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now if Lawes be not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then both theſe parts, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the whol fals to the ground. That is, if neither good men, who live according to the Law, be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor evill men and tranſgreſſors
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34460:99"/>of the Law puniſhed, then how can the Common-wealth long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. And therefore as Chyrurgions cut off a rotten member from the body, leaſt it ſhould endanger the whole body: So Magiſtrates ſhould puniſh, and take away thoſe who by their lewdneſſe, wickedneſſe, and inſolencies, infect and polute the Common-wealth; the inflicting of of puniſhment upon Malefactors, being a point and part of good zeale in a Magiſtrate. <hi>Bonos punit, qui ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis parcit,</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca.</hi> He puniſheth a good man, who ſpareth and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth not an evill man. Yea it is dangerous for a Magiſtrate not to correct, and (when the fault truely deſerves it) to cut off tranſgreſſors: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They make themſelves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereby of their ſequent faults: as <hi>Will Summers</hi> ſaid unto the King, that the murtherer had ſlaine one man, &amp; he two: Becauſe if the King had executed the Law upon him for the firſt murther, then the other had not dyed by him. And</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:34460:100"/>
                  <p n="2">2. When wicked men ſinne, and are not puniſhed, it animates and emboldens others to doe the like. And therefore as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> ſaid, <hi>It is better that one dye, then that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould periſh;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 11.50.</note> So I ſay, it is better that one ſcabbed ſheepe ſhould be ſlaine, then ſuffer it to infect the whole flocke. And therefore it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary, that Magiſtrates ſhould ſome times not onely unſheath the ſword, but alſo ſtrike with the ſword: becauſe as the Proverb is, too much pittie ſpoyles a Citie. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is the reputation of a Citie and Nation, to have the Lawes execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein without remiſſeneſſe, and partiality: and contrarily it is a diſgrace and ſcandall unto a place, to have the ſword of juſtice ſo faſt locked in the ſcabert, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drawn out, nor the Lawes at all executed, nor juſtice admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. And therefore if Magiſtrates regard their owne credit, or the reputation of their Countrey, they muſt be carefull to execute the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34460:100"/>Lawes upon Malefactors, and Law-breakers. And</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Rulers and Governours are ſworne to rule according to the Lawes, and carefully to execute the Lawes; and not to doe this, is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their oath. And therefore if they would not be forſworne, they muſt not hold the ſword for naught, neither be onely ſcare-crowes, but execute the Lawes, by incouraging and rewarding the good, and by puniſhing the evill. And</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is dangerous for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates themſelves not to adminiſter juſtice, in relieving of the injured and oppreſſed; as may appeare in the perſon of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who having ſubdued almoſt all <hi>Greece,</hi> and being in the top of his glory, celebrating at one time the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his ſonne <hi>Alexander,</hi> and of one of his daughters, with great Pompe and magnificence; as he was marching withall his Traine betwixt the two Bridegroomes (his owne ſonne, and his ſonne in Law)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34460:101"/>to ſee the ſports and paſtimes which were prepared for the ſolemnity of the marriage; behold ſuddenly a young <hi>Macedonian</hi> Gentleman, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> ranne at him, and ſlew him in the midſt of the preſſe, for not regarding to doe him juſtice, when he complained unto him, of an injury done by one of the Peeres of the Realme. And therefore if Magiſtrates would not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of the peoples ſinnes; if they would not aimate and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden people to ſinne; if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the credit of their Countrey, or their owne oath, or ſafety, then they muſt execute the Lawes upon tranſgreſſors. Now</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As Magiſtrates muſt execute the Lawes,<note place="margin" type="runSum">3 They muſt be juſt in judgment.</note> ſo they muſt be juſt in judgement, adminiſtring the Law, equally and juſtly without reſpect of perſons. As there were two Pillars before <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, viz.<note place="margin">1 Kin. 7.21. 2 Chr. 3.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Iachin, id eſt, God will establiſh,</hi> nad <hi>Bohaz, id est, Strength,</hi> which two Pillars were ſet up to behold the porch of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34460:101"/>So there are two Pillars, which uphold our Church and State, viz. <hi>Religion</hi> (of which by and by) and <hi>Iustice;</hi> true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> upholding the <hi>Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 122.3, 4, 5.</note> and <hi>Iustice</hi> the <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may more fitly be learned. <hi>The ſword and buckler of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> then <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> were. <hi>The King</hi> (ſaith King <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>By judgement and justice establiſheth the Land.</hi> Prov. 29.4.<note place="margin">Pſ. 72.1.</note> For which cauſe his Kingly father deſires the Lord to give theſe unto the King. And therefore Magiſtrates muſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter juſt judgement without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons. <hi>Anacharſus</hi> ſaid, that Lawes did rightly reſemble the Spiders web, becauſe they take hold of little Flyes, and Gnats, which fall into them, but the great ones will breake and runne through them at their will. But indeed this is neither the fault of the Law, nor Law-giver, but of the Magiſtrate, who doth admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it with partiality, and reſpect of perſons, which ſhould not be:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34460:102"/>For as the Sun is not one to a poor man, and another to a rich, but common alike to all: So a Prince and Magiſtrate ought not to reſpect the perſon but the matter. <hi>Tatius</hi> the fellow King of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Romulus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> for not doing juſtice in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing certaine of his friends and kinsfolkes, and had robbed and murdered certaine Embaſſadours which came to <hi>Rome,</hi> was ſo watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the kindred of the ſlaine, that they ſlew him as he was ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to his gods, becauſe the could not obtaine juſtice at his hands. <hi>Malum conſilium conſultori peſſimum,</hi> as evill counſell is often worſt unto him who gives it, ſo is neglect of juſtice to him who ſhould admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it. And therefore all Magiſtrates who deſire the ſafety of themſelves, and the preſervation of the State, ought to judge with righteous judgement. And</p>
                  <p n="4">4.<note place="margin" type="runSum">4 They muſt be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous.</note> As Magiſtrates muſt be juſt and upright in the execution of the Lawes, ſo muſt they alſo be magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous, and couragious in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34460:102"/>thereof. For it behooveth a Prince or Ruler, to be of ſuch zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and godly courage, that hee alwayes ſhew himſelfe to be as a ſtrong wall for the defence of his people, Religion and Lawes. Yea, it is requiſite for all thoſe who have rule and governance in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale under their Prince, to know the bounds of their State, and the full effect of their dutie;<note place="margin">Lactantius.</note> that by a couragious and undaunted execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of juſtice, they may be feared, and by ſhewing mercy, they may be loved. Magiſtrates muſt be ſo magnanimous, that they omit not the execution of the Lawes for feare of any, and ſo reſolute, that nothing may hinder them from the adminiſtration of Juſtice. The Naturaliſts obſerve, that although the great Owle bee in ſhape like other Owles, yet in bigneſſe, and in ſharpe talents ſhe reſſembles the Eagle: but no withſtanding her bigneſſe and talents, ſhee wanteth courage, and is a very cowardly bird. And ſuch are evill and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34460:103"/>Governours, who being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with authoritie, doe not or dare not bend their force for the ſuppreſſing of evill, and reſiſting of common enemies. Magiſtrates muſt not onely have a good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo a religious reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the executing of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For otherwiſe</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Importunity of friends and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will overcome them if they be mutable &amp; weake in reſolution. And</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Love, or hatred, or anger, will blind them if they be paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and partiall Judges.

And</p>
                  <p n="5">5.<note place="margin" type="runSum">5. They muſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word.</note> As Magiſtrates muſt be coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and reſolute, ſo they muſt

Here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that there are two ſorts of lawes, namely permiſſive and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive. Now although humane lawes often permit thoſe things whch are not warranted by the word of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> permitted unlawfull divorces, and our Land permits uſury, for the avoyding of ſome great inconveniency; yet they muſt never command any thing to be done, whch is contrary to the word, and Law of the Lord. <hi>Caius</hi> a Romane Emperour, ſent <hi>Petronius</hi> into Syria, with commandement to bid battle unto the Jewes,<note place="margin">Ioſephus.</note> if they would not receive his image into their Temple, which they refuſed, with theſe words, <hi>They had rather die, then turne from the Lawes of God.</hi> And as all godly Chriſtians ſhould ſay thus, That they had rather die, then doe any thing contrary to the Law of God; ſo all good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſhould thus ſay, That they had rather die, then command ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to doe any thing contrary, or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34460:104"/>not according to the will of God, or not governe according to that rule, which is the ſquare and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of all pious and perfect go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34460:104"/>and affectionate towards the gods in prayers, oathes, oracles, and prophecies, through the meanes of feare, and hope of the divine nature, which they imprinted in them. And certainely, if all our Chriſtian Magiſtrates would make it their principall care to advance Religion, and to compell men to worſhip and ſerve the Lord, both by their precepts and preſidents, both by threatnings and mild ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, both by countenancing the good and religious, and by diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king &amp; diſaffecting the irreligious and profane; then certainly wee ſhould quickly have a flouriſhing Church and State. <hi>Octavius</hi> prayed God that it might be ſaid, That by him the Common-wealth of Rome was preſerved from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and that at his death he might carry with him that hope. That it ſhould remaine many ages in that Eſtate he left it.<note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> This ſhould indeed be the care, and deſire of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Ruler, and the way and meanes thereunto is, to labour to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34460:105"/>advance Religion, and the pure worſhip of God; for where true Religion is profeſſed, and the Lord truly worſhiped, and the Goſpell ſincerely and powerfully preached, there wee may bee ſure that the Church and State ſhall be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſo long as it continues in that courſe, and the Magiſtrates in that care of Religion. And therefore if all our Governours (as they ought) doe deſire, that our Church, Common-wealth and State, may by them or by their meanes, be preſerved from all danger, and that wee may long flouriſh after their deaths, then let them while they live, labour to protect, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and defend the truth, and true Religion of Chriſt, and advance, propagate, and enlarge his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the preaching of the Goſpell, even from Dan to Beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba.

Now in theſe precepts there is no queſtion, but Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ought to be obeyed, becauſe as the Lords Vicegerents, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe nothing upon us, but the Lords owne yoke.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some Magiſtrates command things ſimply evill; as to fall down before a falſe God. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. or not to fall downe, and pray unto the

                  <p n="3">3.

If one member ſhould be at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, and hold warre with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how could the body ſubſiſt. Now in this our Church and State,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34460:111"/>we are or ſhould be members of one and the ſame body (Rom. 12.4, 5, &amp;c. 1 Corinth. 12.12, &amp;c.

Temporall and Spirituall evils are of two ſorts; to wit, either feared or felt; and anſwerably thereunto, wee pray either to be preſerved from them, or for the prevention of them, when wee feare them: Or,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34460:114"/>to be delivered from them, or, for the removall of them, when they are felt by us, and lye upon us. Now prayer is profitable for both theſe; <hi>viz.</hi> both for the prevention of evils, and preſervation out of evils. Or</p>
                  <p>Secondly, things to bee prayed for, are good; which likewiſe are threefold, namely, temporall, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and eternall.

                  <p>And our Saviour reſolves this, bidding us pray unto <hi>Our Father:</hi> that is, unto God, who is</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Father of light:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt come and pray unto him, with the true ſincerity of the heart; for if we call upon him with feigned lips, he will find it out with his All-ſeeing eye. And</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt argument is taken from <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 50 15. <hi>Call upon me, ſaith the Lord, and I will deliver thee.</hi> He that alone is aole to deliver us, to him alone muſt we pray. But the Lord alone is able to deliver us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto him alone we muſt pray.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond taken from <hi>Romans</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:34460:118"/>10.14. <hi>How can we call upon him, in whom we have not beleeved.</hi> He unto whom we muſt pray, muſt be of that nature, quality, and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we may as well truſt in him, as pray unto him.

                  </p>
                  <p>The third is taken from <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.20. <hi>Curſed be he who ſhall offer burnt offrings unto any but unto the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Sacrifice and burnt offerings in the <hi>O.

                     </gap>e in the Old. Therefore prayer is now as proper unto the Lord as Sacrifice was then. The Minor is proved thus, The Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſaith, 1.11. <hi>That incenſe muſt he offered up unto God:</hi> and Same <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Timoth</hi> 2.8) ſaith, <hi>That the lifting up of pure hands is meant thereby.</hi> And therefore it is the clear Doctrine of the ſacred Scriptures, <hi>That prayer is to be offred up onely unto God.</hi>

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:34460:119"/>
                  <p>Oh but (may ſome ſay) <hi>When must we pray unto God?</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before we begin any worke at leaſt of weight; &amp; the more weighty and important the worke is, the more earneſt muſt we be in our prayers before the undertaking thereof. Becauſe the particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, affaires, and workes, which this might be applied unto, are in a manner infinite: I will therefore omit the application thereof unto any particulars, and by ſome ground and proofes onely confirme the truth of the aſſertion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: viz. <hi>That before we doe undertake any worke, at least of weight or moment, we must begge a bleſſing thereupon of God by prayer.</hi> Pray (ſaith <hi>Socrates</hi>) in thy heart unto God at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all thy workes, that thou mayſt bring them to a good conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Lord gave <hi>Narſeies</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, more through zealous prayers that he uſed, then his force, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; for he never went to ſea, nor began battaile, nor determined of warre, nor mounted on horſe-back,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34460:119"/>but firſt he went to the Temple, and ſerved God. The leſſons of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Plato,</hi> and their diſciples,<note place="margin">Blondus.</note> began and ended with prayer. So the <hi>Brachmans</hi> among the <hi>Indians,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Magi</hi> among the <hi>Perſians.</hi> never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan any thing without praying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. And <hi>Ovid</hi> begins his Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphofis, and <hi>Cleanthes</hi> his Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicke verſes, with prayer. <hi>Plinie</hi> in an Oration which he made in the praiſe of Trajane, commended the cuſtome of the Ancients, in making invocations and prayers before the beginning of their works; ſaying, that there can be no aſſured or wiſe beginning of any enterpriſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpeciall aide and asſiſtance of God.<note place="margin">1 Chro. 29.9.</note> And thus when our Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet was about to provide oblations for the Temple, he firſt prayes;<note place="margin">1 King.</note> as doth alſo <hi>Solomon</hi> when he dedicated the Temple. And thus all our wages, workes, affaires, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and buſineſſes, muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand, and begun with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: for thoſe actions which we dare not pray unto God to bleſſe, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

                  <p n="2">2. We pray in our neceſſities, or make our requeſts knowne unto God by prayer, when we are ſenſible of either want or woe; either defect or ciſtreſſe. Indeed I doe not ſay, that we muſt then onely pray unto God when poverty pricketh, or neceſſity urgeth, or ſome imminent danger enforceth us, and ſpurreth us forward to pray: for every one will doe thus: viz. Cry, and runne unto God in their affliction, miſery, and danger; as we may ſee by the

The like examples we have many in humane Hiſtories; I will name onely this one, viz.

I muſt <hi>unſay</hi> this againe, and entreat my Reader to pray no oftner unto God, then he hath need

                  <p n="1">1.

Wherefore let us make our owne wants firſt knowne unto God, and labour for the pardon of our ſinnes, and our reconciliation with God; and then

                  <p n="1">1. To pray in faith, is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and remember the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, contained in the word; thoſe promiſes being the foundation of our faith. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To pray in faith, is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite, and give faith to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes apprehended and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, beleeving that they ſhall be fulfilled in us. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To pray in faith, is to pray in this confidence and aſſurance, that (according to the promiſes) our prayers ſhall bee heard, and our requeſts granted. Or to pray for thoſe things which by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine faith wee hope for.<note place="margin">Exod. 17.1 Kin. 18. Exod. 9.25.</note> And thus <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed in faith for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory againſt <hi>Amalech,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> for raine, <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt thunder, in

And thus ought wee to aske in faith. and pray with aſſurance, that God will heare us. Here obſerve that there is a double kind of aſſurance to wit,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Extraordinary, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of ſome ſpeciall revelation; as here <hi>Moſes</hi> building upon Gods particular promiſes made unto him, was aſſured that his prayer ſhould take effect. Now beſides this there is,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ordinary aſſurance, which is twofold; to wit,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When we pray for ſpirituall things, which concerne life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; and here the faithfull have an abſolute aſſurance to be heard. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When wee pray for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, where our aſſurance is but conditionall, viz. that God will grant us ſuch things ſo farre
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34460:137"/>forth as they are expedient and profitable for us. And therefore let us pray in faith, when wee pray, that is, 1. Let us learne the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the word, and know what promiſes are made unto us in the word, that our prayers may be built upon thoſe promiſes; for otherwiſe they are without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. like the Citie built upon the ſand. 2. Let us confidently beleeve that all the promiſes of the word are true;<note place="margin">Mat. 7.20.</note> and that if we be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, they ſhall bee made good unto us, in the Lords appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, and in his owne ſenſe and meaning.

Then 3. In this confidence and aſſurance, let us pray for thoſe things which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34460:137"/>are neceſſary, either for our ſelves or others; and wee ſhall undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, either procure what wee pray for, or, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap> ſomething which may ſtand us in as much ſteed, and be every way as profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us. And.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin" type="runSum">5. With zeale.</note> Wee muſt pray zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fervently, if wee deſire that our prayers, which wee offer up either for our ſelves, or our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, may be heard and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For methods ſake, I will here point at three things, and that very briefely; viz. 1. That we muſt or ought to pray fervently, and 2. How our zeale and fervour muſt be regulated in our prayers, and 3. That zealous prayers are very prevalent with God.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Zeale is neceſſary, in prayer.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. If wee deſire that our prayers which wee ſend forth unto God, either in the behalfe of our ſelves or others, may bee prevalent with him, according to our deſires, then wee muſt pray zealouſly and fervently. Zealous prayer muſt aſcend, if we deſire that grace may
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34460:138"/>deſcend; becauſe God is a Spirit, and therefore in ſpirit and in truth of the inward man, muſt he be ſerved and ſought unto. Now</p>
                  <p n="2">2.<note place="margin" type="runSum">How zeale muſt be qualified in prayer.</note> It is worth our obſervation, How our zeale in our prayers is to be regulated, namely, According to the nature of the thing which we pray for. Here note, That wee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray for temporall things, or ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſometimes wee pray for things which concerne our bodies, lives, and eſtates; and for theſe we muſt pray modeſtly, moderately, with a willing ſubmiſſion unto Gods will, and not with that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of affection, that wee deſire ſpirituall things with all. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſometimes wee pray for ſpirituall things, now theſe either concerne our ſelves, our God, or our brethren</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes wee pray for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things which concerne our ſelves; as, For the remiſſion and pardon of our ſinnes, and the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away of the judgements which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34460:138"/>worthily deſerve for our ſinnes committed. And here wee muſt pray <hi>zealouſly,</hi> but in the <hi>poſitive degree</hi> of zeale. Sometimes wee pray for the quantity, meaſure, degree, and extent of graces: that is, that the Lord would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to ſhed abroad his grace in our ſoules, and to eſtabliſh our hearts in grace, and to augment and encreaſe his grace in us more and more. And here we muſt pray <hi>more zealouſly,</hi> but yet onely in the <hi>Comparative degree</hi> of zeale: for as wee muſt more zealouſly pray for grace, and the increaſe thereof, then for the pardon of ſinne, and averſion of judgements; ſo there is ſomething elſe which wee muſt more zealouſly deſire, then grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes we pray for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things which concerne our God: that is, when wee pray for his glory, and the advancement thereof, and the ſanctifying of his Name. Now here we ſhould pray <hi>moſt zealouſly</hi> of all in the <hi>ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive degree</hi> of zeale: for the glory
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34460:139"/>of God is to be preferred before any thing that concernes us. And therefore if wee ſhould ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our God trod in the duſt, or his Name diſhonoured, or his truth perſecuted; wee ſhould then dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and redouble our requeſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, with the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> when hee had waged God at the ſtake againſt <hi>Baal</hi> the falſe God, <hi>Oh Lord heare mee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 18 37.</note> 
                     <hi>oh Lord heare me.</hi> Wee ſhould ſay in ſuch a caſe as <hi>Francis Spira</hi> ſaid (an Advocate of Cittadell, under the juriſdiction of Venice, in the borders of ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) in a conflict which hee had within himſelfe, whether he ſhould confeſſe Chriſt or not; <hi>Cast away feare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>oh my ſoule, put on the ſhield of faith, where is now thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courage and conſtarcy, remember that the glory of thy Chriſt lyes now at the ſtake.</hi> Yea, when we pray for thoſe things which concerne Gods glory, wee ſhould ſay as <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſaid, who when Carthage was beſieged by <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſought for peace, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before that time refuſed warre
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34460:139"/>proteſting that hee might with more ſafety have loſt all his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles within the Alpes, then, one at the gates of Carthage; becauſe in thoſe battles hee adventured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ſuperfluity of youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blood, who ſought their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny in the Field of Honour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Banner of <hi>Mars:</hi> but now the Common-wealth lay at the ſtake; and they plaid their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, religions, lives, wives, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and eſtates, and all at one game; and therefore to looſe once now, were to be quite undone for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes we pray for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things (and I will here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne temporall) for others; as namely, for our Countrey; that is, when we pray for the peace and purity of the Church, and the long continuance thereof in peace and purity amongſt us, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of religion, and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull and painfull preaching of the word. Or, when we pray for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34460:140"/>the peace, preſervation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of this our State, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth wherein we live. Now I conceive that we ſhould more zealouſly, and fervently begge theſe things for our Church and State, then any particular bleſſing or grace for our ſelves; becauſe by ſuch a Common-wealth the Lord would be more glorified, then he could be by any particular perſon. And thus we have ſeene, that we muſt pray zealouſly, and how our zeale in our prayers muſt be regulated. Now</p>
                  <p n="3">3.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Zealous prayers are very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall.</note> Obſerve that fervent prayers are very effectuall. Zeale in prayer is the wing which carries it up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; and like <hi>Elias</hi> his Chaniot, tranſports us into heaven. Zeal is like the Eagles wings, whereby we mount up unto God, and like <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> Ladder, by which we aſcend on high, to the moſt high. Zeale in prayer doth often raviſh the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner into the third heavens, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was thereby. As trees that have taken deepe rooting, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34460:140"/>be pulled up: ſo the fervent prayers of the faithfull cannot be driven backe, untll they have aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the preſence of the higheſt. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <p>Although that there bee no fire in the ſteele, yet if wee ſmite it hard upon a flint, fire iſſues out thereof: and ſo if our iron hearts be heaten upon that rocke Chriſt by fervent prayer, either the light or fire of zeale or conſolation, will iſſue thence. And therefore that our prayers may be fierie and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, let us remember that infinite Majeſty before whom and to whom we pray: and the want of thoſe things which we pray for: and let us feare leſt the Lord ſhould juſtly repulſe us, for our cold and careleſſe calling upon him.

As hee who would ſtrike fire out of a flint, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſtrike once but often, yea untill the ſparkes kindle the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: ſo hee who deſites any favour or merey from God, muſt not only once pray for it, but continue and perſevere in prayer, untill his requeſt be granted, and hee have prevayled with God. Let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der turne but to <hi>Luke</hi> 11. the firſt verſe, and ſo forward; and <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. and ſo forward, and obſerve what he reades there, and then hee will not queſtion the power and efficacy of perſeverant prayers.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee have ſeene that our prayers muſt bee humble and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and that our whole man muſt pray; and that wee muſt pray with hearts purged from ſinne, and call upon God in faith, aed with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

                  <p>If any would know what power ſuch prayers as theſe have with God, and how available and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall they are, let him obſerve that ſuch prayers are profitable, both in regard of our ſelves and of others.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Prayer alwayes procures a bleſſing from God unto us.<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Oratio juſti clavis eſt coeli, aſcendit precatio, &amp; deſcendit Dei miſericordia.</hi> Prayer is the key of him: and therefore let but that aſcend up unto God, and then the bleſſings and mercies of God ſhall deſcend downe upon us. But of this I treated in the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faithfull prayer doth corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate

For as a Traveller after that hee hath reſted himſelfe and eaten, beginneth to feele eaſe, and is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed and ſtrengthned, that hee can walke further: even ſo prayer, which is the ſpirituall food of the ſoule, is the cauſe of new forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſtrength, to walke in the wayes of the Lord.

And therefore if wee deſire to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with with all ſpirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings, then let us pray. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Prayer is profitable againſt Sathan. As a City which is not compaſſed and fenced about with wals,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. li. <hi>2.</hi> de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And hence our Saviour and his Apoſtles ſo often teach us to pray againſt this evill one, and enemie of mankind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if wee deſire to bee preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from ſathan, wee muſt pray. And</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Prayer is prevalent againſt God; or it appeaſeth the wrath of God, according to that ſaying. <hi>Flectitur tratus voce rogante Deus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God be angry with us, yet faithfull prayers wil pacifie and appeaſe him.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34460:144"/>labour to reconcile our ſelves unto our God, by powerfull and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent prayers. And therefore wee muſt pray both for the pardon of our ſinnes, and the averſion of Gods judgements. And</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Prayer is prevalent againſt our enemies; and this is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall weapon that <hi>David</hi> fighteth withall againſt his. Let our enemies be forraine, or domeſticall, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, or temporall; ſuch as deſire the ruine of our Church, or of our State, or whatſover they are; prayer is a powerfull weapon againſt them. <hi>Moſes qui cum taceret clamabat,</hi>

                     <hi>cum otiofus staret praeliabatur; ſed etiam de hoſtibus quos non contigerat, triumpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, &amp;c. Moſes</hi> cryed when hee held his peace; hee fought againſt his ſoes as he ſtood idle; he triumphed over them, although hee never tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them; to wit, by faithfull and fervent prayer. Hence the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faith, <hi>Longius vulnerat quam ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitta,</hi> prayer will wound an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie farther off then an arrow, and overtake thoſe who are off from us.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34460:144"/>The Romanes in their warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> were driven to ſuch want of weapons, that they were forced to goe to the Temples, and to take thence the weapons which were conſecrated, and fighting with thoſe weapons againſt their enemies, they prevailed, and became victorious. And thus the weapons wherewith we muſt principally preſerve our ſelves, muſt be divine and holy, ſuch as <hi>Ezechias</hi> drave away <hi>Senacherib</hi> withall, to wit, prayer: and ſuch as the Chriſtians in the primitive times principally uſed, namely, <hi>Preces et lachrymae,</hi> prayers and and teares: for theſe are both the ſafeſt and ſharpeſt weapons we can uſe againſt any enemies. If <hi>Samuel</hi> pray againſt the Philiſtims, the Lord will ſmite them with a great ſlaughter. And if we pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our enemies, we may expect both protection from God for ourſelves, and correction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon our enemies. A La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this Land perſecuting Maſter <hi>Knockes,</hi> did ſay, ſhe could not but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34460:145"/>perſecute him; and yet ſhe feared his prayers, and the ſupplications of thoſe who prayed for him, more then ſhe ſhould feare an army of 20000 men. And indeed all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and perſecutors of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, have cauſe to feare: their <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi> being <hi>mighty,</hi> and their <hi>Protector Almighty;</hi> although themſelves be infirme and weake; as is evident from <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 27. from 7. verſe, and ſo forward.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.<note place="margin">Num. 15.38.29.</note> Prayer is profitable for us, becauſe it draweth downe God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; or becauſe thereby we mount up unto God. The Jewes were commanded to weare frienges upon their garments; for which cauſe they were called <hi>(Calcoth Tephilim) Garments with wings;</hi> and hence <hi>Eliſha</hi> was called <hi>Eliſha cum alis, Eliſha with wings.</hi> becauſe he wore the coate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, which had foure fringes hanging downe at the foure wings of it <hi>(Arbham eamphah) Foure wings;</hi> and this garment was called <hi>Talith, A winged coatc.</hi> Becauſe hee uſed ſtill theſe wings, to put-him in mind of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34460:145"/>prayer, which are the <hi>golden wings of the Dove,</hi> (ſay the Rabbins) which carry us up to heaven. Prayer is the chaine, whereby intending to draw God unto us, we are drawne unto him: even as the rocke drawes the Marriners unto it; when they pull with all their force (the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor being faſtned thereunto) as though they would hale it unto them. Or ſuppoſe there were a chain reaching from earth to heaven, and faſtened in heaven, he who would climbe up thither, thereby, muſt draw the chaine, as though he would pull heaven downe unto him, when the truth is, it is he who is raiſed higher &amp; drawn nearer unto heaven. even thus we by prayer labour to draw downe God unto us, but are indeed thereby drawne unto God. And thus we ſee how, and wherein prayer is profitable for our ſelves. Now</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faithfull, fervent,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Prayer is profitable for others</note> and pure prayers, are profitable alſo for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: or others are ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by the prayers of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34460:146"/>I dare not here goe ſo farre as the Papiſts goe, who tell us that the prayers of Gods children, are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall for the dead; and give us proofe thereof in Saint <hi>Dunſiane,</hi> who underſtanding that the ſoule of King <hi>Edwine</hi> was to be carried into hell, never gave over praying for him, untill he had freed him from that danger, and transferred him into the coaſt of penitent ſoules. I dare not (I ſay) ſay thus, but I dare boldly ſay, that prayer is profitable for the living, and that in diverſe regards; as for example,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The faithfull by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, have procured raine for other. <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> tels us, that when <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> the Philoſopher, had by the prayers of the Chriſtians, obtained a plentiful rain, for the releeving of the army over which he was; he writ a letter unto the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Chriſtians had moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull and prevalent weapons, to wit, prayers unto God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he perſwads the Senate, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from the perſecution of the

                     </gap> &amp;c. leſt (ſaith he) they fight againſt with theſe potent weapons. And thus we ſee <hi>Elias</hi> procures raine for <hi>Ahab,</hi> by prayer unto God. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The faithfull by their prayers ſometimes procure health unto the ſicke: according to that of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> the faithfull prayers of the Saints, ſhall ſave the ſicke. And I conceive that the Apoſtles in their mirrculous Cures, uſed prayer. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Marullus.</note> by his prayers, reſtored the diſtracted daughter of <hi>Polemius</hi> King of <hi>India,</hi> to her former ſences. And.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The faithfull have benefited ſome by their prayers, by procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereby the deſtruction of their enemies. Thus King <hi>Oſwald</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian by Prayer unto God, obtained victory againſt <hi>Cadwallo,</hi> and <hi>Penda,</hi> the Britaine Kings, who came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him with a mightie hoſt. And hereby he benefited both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his army. <hi>Aurelius Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Emperour, in his expedition
